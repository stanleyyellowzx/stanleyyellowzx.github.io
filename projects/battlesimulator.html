    <h1>Battle Simulator</h1>
    <h2>Last updated: May 14 2025</h2>
    <h3>Project Date: June 2023</h3>
    <h4>Technologies used: Java</h4>
    <p>This was my first ever project that I created and it was a project that I created as my final project for a CS class in high school. I've always loved Pokemon, so I wanted to create a turn based battle simulation game. At the time, I did not really understand how to make GUIs, so I stuck with just a text based game which runs in the terminal. Having built this project  helped solidify my programming fundamentals, especially with object oriented programming. This also made the transition to University much smoother as University is much faster pace, but I already had previous programming experience.</p>

    <p>The image above is how the program starts. You first enter your name and then you can see what battlers there are. The image does not show all of the battlers, but there are 11 of them. Each battler also has three moves that they can use, but they are not shown here.</p>
    <br>

    <p>Next, you would choose the battlers you want by entering the number corresponding to the battler that you want. You are allowed to choose duplicate battlers, like in the image above. Once you select your battlers, some text will popup showing you what your team is.</p>
    <br>

    <p>Once you finish selecting your team, it throws you into the first round of battle. You start by sending out one of your three battlers, and then you select a move. A combat log will be then be shown after each turn.</p>

    <p>Once a round finishes, it will keep track of your win streak. You can then keep on playing, or you can leave the game. You are also able to save your winstreak, and it does this by writing your name along with your winstreak to a file.</p>

    <h2 class="reflections">Reflections</h2>
    <p>Since this was my first ever project, there are a lot of things that I would change about this project. At the time, I think reading and writing from files in Java was very confusing to me, so I opted to create a class to store all of the battlers and moves. If I were to re-create this, I would definitely save this information in a file of some sort. Another improvement would be to create a GUI for this, as the text in the terminal starts getting very clogged up very quickly. All in all, this was still a great learning experience for me.</p>
