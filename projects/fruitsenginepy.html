    <h1>Fruits Search Engine (Python Version)</h1>
    <h2>Last updated: May 14 2025</h2>
    <h3>Project Date: October 2023</h3>
    <h4>Technologies used: Python</h4>
    <p>This was the first project I built since entering University. This was the first time that I worked with HTML data and web scraping. The project scrapes data from sites with a format like this link: <a href="https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~davidmckenney/tinyfruits/N-0.html">Link</a> and then calculates TF-IDFs for the unique words that are found, and page ranks. These calculated values then get used to determine which pages show up for search queries. Depending on the amount of incoming/outgoing links, the scraping can take anywhere from a few seconds to 2 minutes.</p>

    <p>This project unfortunately does not have a GUI, so you need to run it from a terminal. As a result, the results returned from a search are not formatted nicely like in the image above.</p>

    <h2 class="reflections">Reflections</h2>
    <p>This was my first Python project. Before creating this, I had experience with Java, so when comparing Python with Java, I think I prefer Java syntax. Although I do appreciate that Python is very simple to write. The most difficult part of this project was saving and reading data. Scraping and parsing the data was simple since Python has lots of functions to work with string data, but I had to figure out how to create a mapping for data to files. Once the mapping was created, I also had to figure out how to re-read the data back into the program. These two things were the biggest obstacles in creating this project.</p>
