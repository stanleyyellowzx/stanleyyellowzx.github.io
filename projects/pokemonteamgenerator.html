    <h1>Pokemon Team Generator</h1>
    <h2>Last updated: May 14 2025</h2>
    <h3>Project Date: July 2024 - October 2024</h3>
    <h4>Technologies used: JavaScript, HTML, CSS</h4>

    <p>The project date is a bit misleading, as I worked on this project on and off. This project was created to learn basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This project only has a frontend, although it is not responsive. I had the idea of creating this because I found that often times when I played Pokemon games, I would generally use the same Pokemon again and again. As a result, I wanted to create a random team generator to randomly decide my team. This generator is completely random, and does not account for duplicates, so it may generate a team with the same Pokemon.</p>

    <p>This was my first time using HTML and CSS, so I created this super simple menu, although it does not look very pretty. Right now, the generator supports all regions that currently exist, and although this image does not show it, you can scroll down a bit to go to a national team generator, which picks Pokemon randomly from any generation.</p>

    <p>This is the menu for generating a team. This image specifically uses the Kanto team generator. In this menu, I created the option of including starter pokemon, as you can only choose one of them at the beginning of a game. I also included an option to include legendary/mythical Pokemon because you can use those Pokemon, but for me personally, I don't like using those Pokemon so I added this button to exclude them from generation. When you press the generate team button, there may be a slight delay because the program fetches data from PokeAPI, an open-source RESTful API.</p>

    <p>From this project, I managed to learn the basics of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, but also that front end design is difficult. There are very many things that you can do with bare HTML and CSS, and with this project, I only really scratched the surface of what you are able to do with it.</p>
